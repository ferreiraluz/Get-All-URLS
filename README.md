# Get-All-URLS
The code implements an asynchronous function called getAllUrlsInDomain, which takes a domain parameter representing the domain to crawl. The function performs a crawling process using a depth-first search approach, visiting each URL within the specified domain. It avoids revisiting URLs to prevent infinite loops.
